    <h1>Camelids</h1>
    <p>The four llamas and two camels are camelids. Camelids tend to be large and are strictly herbivorous.
        Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways.<br>They have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered
        digestive tract;
        an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile; and an <br> isolated incisor in the upper
        jaw.
        They have log legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body, look longer still.

        Wikipedia)
